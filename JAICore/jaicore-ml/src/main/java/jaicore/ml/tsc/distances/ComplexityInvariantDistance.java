/**
 * Implementation of the Complexity Invariant Distance (CID) measure as
 * published in "A Complexity-Invariant Distance Measure for Time Series" by
 * Gustavo E.A.P.A. Batista, Xiaoyue Wang and Eamonn J. Keogh.
 *
 * The authors address the <i>complexity</i> invariant of time series distance
 * measures. That is, that time series with higher complexity tend to be further
 * apart under current distance measures than pairs of simple objects.
 *
 * Given a complexity measure <code>c</code> and a distance measure
 * <code>d</code>, the Complexity Invariant Distance for the two time series
 * <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> is:
 * <code>d(A, B) * (max(c(A), c(B)) / min(c(A), c(B)))</code>.
