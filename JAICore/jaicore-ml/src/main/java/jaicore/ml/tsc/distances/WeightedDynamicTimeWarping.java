/**
 * Implementation of the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) measure as published in
 * "Weighted dynamic time warping for time series classification" by Young-Seon
 * Jeong, Myong K. Jeong and Olufemi A. Omitaomu.
 *
 * DTW does not account for the relative importance regarding the phase
 * difference between a reference point and a testing point. This may lead to
 * misclassification especially in applications where the shape similarity
 * between two sequences is a major consideration for an accurate recognition.
 * Therefore, [the authors] propose a novel distance measure, called a weighted
 * DTW (WDTW), which is a penalty-based DTW. [Their] approach penalizes points
 * with higher phase difference between a reference point and a testing point in
 * order to prevent minimum distance distortion caused by outliers.
