/**
 * Implementation of Shotgun Distance measure as published in "Towards Time
 * Series Classfication without Human Preprocessing" by Patrick Sch√§fer (2014).
 *
 * To make many of the standard methods to calculate the distance betwenn two
 * time series applicable, a lot of time and effort has to be spent by a domain
 * expert to filter the data and extrdact equal-length, equal-scale and alighned
 * patterns. The Shotgun Distance avoids preprocessing the data for alignment,
 * scaling or length. This is achieved by breaking the query time series into
 * disjoint windows (subsequences) of fixed length. These windows are slid along
 * the sample time series (with stride 1) to find the best matching position in
 * terms of minimizing a distance metric (e.g. Euclidean distance or DTW
 * distance).
