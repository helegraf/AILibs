 * The algorithms should actually also be interruptible, but since this is often not the case, we require the cancel method to

 * 
 * Implementation of both Iterable and Iterator: We envision that an object of an algorithm really only represents one run, so
 * there is really no reason to have an additional object only to hold the state.
